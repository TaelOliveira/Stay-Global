  <h3 id="topic1">What to study?</h3>

  <p>
    You probably already have some idea of what you would like to study. But there are a number of courses and schools
    for you to know a little more before making your decision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Check it out on the website:
    <a href="https://cricos.education.gov.au/Course/CourseSearch.aspx">
      https://cricos.education.gov.au/Course/CourseSearch.aspx</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Choose the state you want to study, the name and type of course and click on "start search". When you see the course
    that interests you click on it to open the details: school information, course time and price. See how simple it is.

    consultation with our team.

  <h3 id="topic2">How much will it cost?</h3>

  <p>

    you applied it yourself. The difference is that with us you have more security in the process and our counselor will
    present you with several options for schools that suit your needs. There will be four fees in your quote.
