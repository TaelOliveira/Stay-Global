  </p>

  <h3 class="topic" id="topic1">What is a student visa?</h3>

  <p>
    The Student visa (subclass 500) allows you to remain in Australia for the purpose of studying. You are also allow to
    work part-time. The student must be enrolled with an Australian education provider with CRICOS registration.
  </p>

  <h3 class="topic" id="topic2">Why apply for a student visa?</h3>

  <p>For tree reasons:</p>

  <h4 class="subtitle">Study at globally ranked institutions</h4>

  <p>
    Australia offers a diverse range of study options for international students, such as English courses, vocational
    education and training (VET) and technical and higher education (TAFE), as well as undergraduate (bachelor's) and
    postgraduate programs. It will certainly be a differential to have an international course in one of the ranked
    schools in your curriculum.
  </p>

  <h4 class="subtitle">Study and work</h4>

  <p>
    When you have a student visa, you are allowing to work 40 hours per fortnight (fortnight means 14 days starting on a
    Monday) and more than 40 hours on your vacation. Most students pay their expenses (accommodation and food) by
    working here. Often, they also make extra money to travel around Asia and Australia. Australia is full of job
    opportunities in several areas.
  </p>

    fun with your friends. At the same time, studying and developing your career.
